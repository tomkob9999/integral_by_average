# Integral-Average Relationship: A Unified Framework in Calculus

## Core Equations

### 1. Base Equation
The base equation represents the total accumulation of a function over a range:

$$
F = \int f(x) \, dx
$$

This is the foundational equation of integration, describing the total effect of a function $f(x)$ across a given range.

### 2. Integral-Average Equation
The **Integral-Average Equation** connects integration to averages:

$$
E[f] = \frac{\int f(x) \, dx}{x}
$$

Where:
- $E[f]$ is the average height of $f(x)$ over the interval $x$.
- $\int f(x) \, dx$ is the total accumulation of $f(x)$.
- $x$ is the interval length.

Rearranging gives:

$$
\int f(x) \, dx = E[f] \cdot x
$$

This equation reinterprets integration as **scaling the average height by the range**.

### 3. Average Slope Equation
The **Average Slope Equation** expresses the average slope of a function over an interval $[a, b]$:

$$
E\left[\frac{df}{dx}\right] = \frac{\int_a^b \frac{df}{dx} \, dx}{b-a}
$$

Where:
- $E\left[\frac{df}{dx}\right]$ is the average slope of the function over the interval $[a, b]$.
- $\frac{df}{dx}$ is the instantaneous slope (derivative).
- $\int_a^b \frac{df}{dx} \, dx$ represents the total change in the function over the interval.

The **total change** in the function is given by:

$$
f(b) - f(a) = \int_a^b \frac{df}{dx} \, dx
$$

By substituting the total change into the Average Slope Equation:

$$
E\left[\frac{df}{dx}\right] = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}
$$

This highlights that:
1. The **average slope** over an interval is the total change in the function divided by the interval length.
2. The **integral of the derivative** calculates the exact change in the function over the interval.
